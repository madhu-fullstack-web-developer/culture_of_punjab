        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Bhangra is a vibrant and energetic folk dance that originated in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Traditionally, it was performed by farmers to celebrate the harvest season, especially during the Vaisakhi festival. Over time, Bhangra has evolved and gained international recognition, becoming a symbol of Punjabi culture.</p><br>

        <h2>Music:</h2>
        <p> The dance is accompanied by lively beats of traditional instruments, primarily the dhol (a double-headed drum), tumbi (a single-stringed instrument), and chimta (metal tongs with jingles). These instruments create a rhythmic and upbeat tempo that drives the dance's energetic movements.</p><br>

        <h2>Costume:</h2>
        <p>Male dancers typically wear a colorful kurta (a long shirt) paired with a lungi or chaadra (a piece of cloth wrapped around the waist), and accessorize with a pagri (turban) that often features a decorative fan called a turla. These vibrant costumes enhance the visual appeal of the performance.</p>
